## Events

### Winter 2024 Bootcamp - Jan 2024

#### Day 1
Instructor: Yu Huang, Ph.D. candidate, Department of Earth and Environment Engineering Columbia University

**Learning Goals**:
1. Learn to process, analyze and visualize climate data with scientific Python using the LEAP-Pangeo Jupyter Hub;
2. Gain a understanding of fundamental climate concepts, alongside common diagnostic statistics and techniques.

The workplan for Day-1 is on the following page. We mainly follow the workshop 2023 Train- the-Trainer Bootcamp Day 1: Climate and Geospatial Data Analysis by Prof. Ryan Abernathey. 
The day is divided into lecture sessions and interactive studios, offering participants the chance to solidify their learning through hands-on practice. 
Students are asked to mirror the instructor‚Äôs each step during lecture sessions using LEAP-Pangeo Hub and are encouraged to work in groups.
